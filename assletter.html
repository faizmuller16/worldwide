        Student's complain against the teaching staff
    </h3>

    <p>
        I wish to bring to your notice the complaints of the students against the teaching staff. As a senior prefect of
        the school, I have heard several complaints against the members of the teaching staff of the school. My office
        has been inundated with a lot of grievances, some of them written down in form of a protest letter and some
        verbally. <br> </p>

    <br>
    <p> The first complaint is that many teachers fail to attend classes to teach
        the students. The fact is that
        they are either absent from school or they refuse to come out to teach the students during their various class
        periods. They are always absent from classes and this has resulted in being idle most of the time. In most
        cases, the students are left unoccupied to roam the school compound. <br> </p>


    <br>
    <p> The second grievance of thhe students is that teachers come late to school
        everyday. Most times, students do
        not have teachers on duty to conduct the morning devotion for them. Therefore, students are left to go to
        classes the normal morning assembly and prayers. This also affects the first two lessons which most students
        miss simply because teachers come late to school. Similarly, there are also cases of teachers coming late to
        school in the morning and when they eventually come, they will sit down in the staffroom discussing irrelevant
        things instead of going to their classes. <br> </p>

    <br>
    <p> The students also complained about teachers lazy attitude and failure to
        prepare adequately before going to
        teach. Many of them do not have lesson notes and when they have, the notes are hazhazardly prepared. This has
        made their teaching disjointed and uninteresting according to the students. There are also other grievances such
        as male teachers making love advances to the female students. I would want you to investigate this allegations
        properly. <br> </p>

    <br>
    <p> In view of these all these complaints, I would be shrinking in my
        responsibilities if I fail to inform you
        that the students are secretly planning a riot. In order to avert this riot, therefore , I would be delighted if
        you could correct all these anomalies so as to bring sanity and restore a sense of duty in the members of the
        teaching staff. Please sir, it demands urgent attention as nothing else can make the students change their
        minds. </p>
